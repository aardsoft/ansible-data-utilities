** Introduction
This repository hosts some of our publicly available Ansible extensions, as well as some documentation on how we are using Ansible. The full documentation for the latest development version is [[https://doc-head.aardsoft.fi/ansible/data-utilities/][available here]].

The recommended way of using this collection is to include it as a git submodule into your Ansible configuration(s), and adjust plugin search paths in =ansible.cfg=.

Example playbooks to demonstrate how to use the extensions provided here are included in the [[./playbooks][playbooks]] directory. To run all of them you can execute =ansible-playbook playbooks/all.yml=
